Neighborhood Waste Segregation & Pickup Scheduler
ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Neighborhood Waste Segregation & Pickup Scheduler is a console-based Java application designed to promote efficient and sustainable waste management in residential areas. The system allows residents to easily register, log in, and schedule waste pickups based on available time slots. Users can also classify their waste into categories such as Organic, Recyclable, and Hazardous, ensuring proper segregation before collection.

On the other side, drivers benefit from the system by accessing optimized pickup routes, which reduces travel time and fuel consumption, ultimately making the waste collection process more eco-friendly. In addition, users can view their past waste disposal history, creating awareness and accountability towards responsible waste management.

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, while also applying basic I/O operations for user interaction and data handling.
